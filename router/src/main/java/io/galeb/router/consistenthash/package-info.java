/**
 * <b>Provides simple consistent hash solution.</b>
 * <p>
 * Consistent hashing is based on mapping each object to a point on the
 * edge of a circle (or equivalently, mapping each object to a real angle).
 * <p>
 * This package provides classes who maps each available node to many
 * pseudo-randomly distributed points on the edge of the same circle.
